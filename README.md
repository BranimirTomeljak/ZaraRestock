ZaraRestock

An application for live tracking and notifying users when specific items in a certain size come back in stock. The need arose because Zara doesn’t offer this option, and it’s very useful for gaining an advantage over other customers — especially during major sales. The frontend was built with React Native (Android, iOS, and web), and the backend with Express.js. The app’s main logic relies on web scraping and “tricking” Zara’s servers. It functions fully on all platforms and was, for a time, running on a server hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
